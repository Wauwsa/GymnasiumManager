# GymnasiumManager
A Management Website for Gymnasiums

This is a project for school, where me and @etuq have decided to make a Webapp, which acts as a Manager for our School.
We will be coding it using the Web Framework Django, which works with Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Django Templating Language.

It offers features like:
- Students / Teacher Accounts
- Create Subjects, Topics and Grades
- Register the absence of Students
- Upload a picture of the absence letter
- Get a Diagram of your grades in the last year!
- More!
